# Token Design: Kickoff Document
This document could form the start of the documentation towards an initial Token design document for NFTDAO.

# Status Quo
**What we have:** 
- communinity of about 100 active people in Discord and (few) on github
- USD 48k in Catalyst funds (ADA)
- the mission to create in an opensource manner a composable framework for the Cardano community, in order for them to create NFT powered apps

# Goal
**Streamline community efforts towards** 
- zero redundancy 
- full transparency
- maximum collaboration
- decentralized decision making

# Token Design Elements
**TO DO** Define the following properties

## Actors
Who will engage with the token? And when (in what phase/Stage)? Prosumers? Consumers? Businesses? Developers? Other third parties?

## Token Type
What type of token is it? Does it provide access to a digital service? The right to contribute work to a network? The right to vote on governance decisions?

## Network Value
Are the tokens  tied to the value and development of the network? Are tokens linked to key interactions between network participants and the value exchanged over the network?

## Token's value creation
What value is pegged to or infused within the token? What's the token facilitating?

## Token's value capture
Will network adoption drive demand (price appreciation) for the Token? If not what will?

## System objective
Whats the main objective of the system? -> *see **GOALS** above* for propositions

## Token design Canvas
coming soon
